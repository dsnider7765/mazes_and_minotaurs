        Barbarians are savage warriors from uncivilized lands - or regarded as such by members of

        they may include Celts, Goths, Cimbrians and, of course, Cimmerians.\n
        \n
        Barbarians are born fighters, whose ferocity in battle largely makes up for their lack of
        military discipline.
